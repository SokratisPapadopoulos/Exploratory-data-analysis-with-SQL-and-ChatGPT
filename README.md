## üìù¬†Project Task

I wanted to do a project exclusively about EDA with SQL. I also wanted to be kind of unique and new. So this is what i came up with.

- Ask ChatGPT to suggest any dataset from the web.
- Load the dataset to Microsoft SQL Server.
- Ask ChatGPT to give me EDA requests for this dataset.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to the dataset by answering these requests.

## ‚úèÔ∏èSteps

These are the steps i followed to complete this project.

- Step 1.

Ask ChatGPT to suggest any dataset from the web.

- Step 2.

Load the dataset to Microsoft SQL Server.

- Step 3.

Ask ChatGPT to give me EDA requests for this dataset.

- Step 4.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to the dataset by answering these requests.

1.	Count the number of records in the dataset.
2.	Retrieve the first 10 records in the dataset.
3.	Retrieve the records for a specific country (e.g. Turkey).
4.	Retrieve the records for a specific year (e.g. 2002).
5.	Retrieve the highest number of child deaths and the corresponding country and year.

9.	Retrieve the countries with the highest and lowest average number of child deaths per year.
10.	Count the number of unique countries in the dataset.
11.	Calculate the total number of child deaths across all countries and years.
12.	Identify the top 10 countries with the highest child mortality rates in 2012.
13.	Calculate the percentage change in child mortality rates for each country between 1952 and 2012.
14.	Identify the country with the biggest difference in child mortality rates between 1952 and 2012.
